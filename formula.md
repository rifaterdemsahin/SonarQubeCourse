port forwarding 
To access your SonarQube service running in Minikube via port forwarding, you can use the `kubectl port-forward` command. This method allows you to forward a port from your local machine to the service within the Minikube cluster.([Sonar Community][1])

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Identify the SonarQube Service Name and Namespace:**
   First, determine the exact name and namespace of your SonarQube service. If you deployed SonarQube using Helm, the service name might be something like `sonarqube-sonarqube`.

   You can list all services in all namespaces with:

   ```bash
   kubectl get services --all-namespaces
   ```



2. **Port Forward the Service:**
   Once you've identified the service name and its namespace, use the following command to forward port 9000 (the default SonarQube port) to your local machine:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward service/<service-name> 9000:9000 -n <namespace>
   ```



Replace `<service-name>` with your actual service name and `<namespace>` with the appropriate namespace.

For example:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/sonarqube-service 9000:9000
```



3. **Access SonarQube in Your Browser:**
   With the port forwarding in place, you can now access the SonarQube interface by navigating to:

   ```
   http://localhost:9000
   ```



This URL will open the SonarQube dashboard running within your Minikube cluster.

### Notes

* Ensure that your SonarQube pods are running and ready before attempting to port forward. You can check the status with:([Sonar Community][2])

```bash
  kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```



* If you encounter issues accessing the service, verify that there are no firewall rules or network policies blocking the connection.

* The `kubectl port-forward` command is suitable for local development and testing purposes. For production environments or sharing access with others, consider setting up a LoadBalancer or Ingress controller.

Let me know if you need assistance with setting up Ingress or exposing the service externally.
